              <p>
                Hi, I'm Rahul ‚Äî a front-end developer passionate about building
                fast, accessible, and user-friendly web apps.
              </p>{" "}
              <p>
                I specialize in React, JavaScript, and modern web tools like
                Vite, Tailwind, and React Router. I enjoy turning complex
                problems into clean, scalable code.
              </p>{" "}
              <p>
                I'm currently exploring advanced state management and diving
                into server-side rendering using frameworks like Remix and
                Next.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of tech, I enjoy hiking, photography, and reading about
                design systems. I'm always excited to collaborate on meaningful
                projects or join teams that value clean code and creative
                thinking.
